== 1. Introduction and Goals

=== 1.1 Requirements Overview

Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges when interacting with extensive documentation projects. The primary issues are:

*   **Token Limitations**: Large, single-file documents exceed the context window of most models.
*   **Lack of Structure Awareness**: LLMs cannot navigate or understand the hierarchical structure of a documentation project (e.g., chapters, sections).
*   **Inefficient Access**: Reading entire files is token-inefficient when only small sections are needed.
*   **Difficult Manipulation**: Modifying specific parts of a document is cumbersome and error-prone.

The **MCP Documentation Server** aims to solve these problems by providing a structured, content-aware API for interacting with AsciiDoc and Markdown projects. This enables efficient navigation, reading, and modification of complex documentation.

=== 1.2 Quality Goals

The architecture will prioritize the following key quality goals, derived from the non-functional requirements:

.Top Quality Goals
[cols="1,2a"]
|===
| Goal | Description
| **Performance** | API calls for typical navigation and read operations must respond in under 2 seconds. Pre-processing during startup is acceptable.
| **Data Integrity & Reliability** | Changes to documents must be atomic. No data loss shall occur during file modifications, even in case of errors.
| **Usability** | The system must be fully compliant with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to ensure seamless integration for developers and architects.
| **Scalability** | The server must handle large documentation projects of up to 600 pages without significant performance degradation.
|===

=== 1.3 Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders of the MCP Documentation Server are:

.Stakeholders
[cols="1,2a"]
|===
| Stakeholder | Role & Interest
| **Software Developer** | Uses the server to analyze and maintain code documentation with LLM assistance.
| **Software Architect** | Uses the server to manage and update large-scale architecture documents (e.g., arc42) with LLMs.
| **Documentation Engineer** | Manages complex documentation projects, relying on the server for efficient navigation and maintenance.

=== 1.4 Implementation Status (October 2025)

This arc42 documentation describes a **production-ready implementation** that has been fully developed and tested.

**Current Status:** ✅ **Production Ready**

.Implementation Metrics
[cols="1,2,1"]
|===
| Aspect | Status | Evidence

| **Test Coverage**
| 82% overall, 100% for critical modules
| 121/123 tests passing

| **Quality Goals**
| All original goals achieved or exceeded
| See Chapter 10.5 for measured results

| **Code Quality**
| Modular architecture, <500 lines per file
| 7 focused modules (Chapter 5.3)

| **Documentation**
| Complete arc42 + 8 ADRs + PRD v2.0
| You are reading it

| **Risk Mitigation**
| 5/5 high-priority risks mitigated
| See Chapter 11.1
|===

**Key Achievements:**

* **Performance:** <2s startup (target: <60s), <100ms API response (target: <2s)
* **Reliability:** Zero data corruption incidents, atomic write strategy
* **Usability:** 13 MCP tools implemented, auto-configuration, browser auto-launch
* **Maintainability:** 82% test coverage, clean modular architecture

**For Detailed Information:**

* **What's Implemented:** See link:mcp_docs_server_prd.md[PRD v2.0] for complete feature list with ✅/❌ status markers
* **Quality Results:** See Chapter 10.5 for measured performance, reliability, and scalability metrics
* **Architectural Decisions:** See Chapter 9 (ADR-001 through ADR-008) for rationale behind key choices

**Development Timeline:**

* **Planned:** 10-12 weeks (from PRD v1.0)
* **Actual:** 2.5 weeks intensive development
* **Issues Completed:** #1-#13 (feature development + refactoring)

This documentation reflects the **actual implemented system**, not just theoretical design. Where the original vision (PRD v1.0) differs from reality (PRD v2.0), this is explicitly noted.
