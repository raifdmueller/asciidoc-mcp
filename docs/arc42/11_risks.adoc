== 11. Risks and Technical Debts

This chapter documents known risks, technical debts, and their current status as of October 2025.

> **Note:** This chapter has been updated to reflect the actual implementation status. Many originally identified risks have been mitigated.

=== 11.1 Mitigated Risks ✅

These risks from the original PRD have been successfully addressed:

.Mitigated Risks
[cols="1,2,2,1"]
|===
| Original Risk | How It Was Mitigated | Evidence | Status

| **Include Resolution Complexity**
| Custom parser with cycle detection, tested with real arc42 docs
| 100% test coverage for document_parser.py, handles circular includes
| ✅ **Mitigated**

| **File Corruption**
| Atomic writes via backup-and-replace strategy (ADR-004)
| Zero corruption incidents in testing, 82% overall test coverage
| ✅ **Mitigated**

| **Performance**
| In-memory index (ADR-002) delivers <2s startup for 600 pages
| Measured: <2s startup, <100ms API calls, ~50MB memory
| ✅ **Mitigated**

| **Format Variations**
| Focused on standard AsciiDoc/Markdown, tested with arc42 templates
| Successfully handles arc42 documentation (600 pages)
| ✅ **Mitigated**

| **Stale Index (No File Watching)**
| File watching implemented with watchdog library
| Auto-refresh working, <500ms to detect and re-index changes
| ✅ **Mitigated**
|===

**Key Insight:** All high-priority risks from the original design were successfully mitigated during implementation. The combination of comprehensive testing (82% coverage) and proven architectural patterns (ADR-001 through ADR-008) eliminated the major risk areas.

=== 11.2 Remaining Risks and Limitations

These are known limitations of the current implementation:

.Current Limitations
[cols="1,2,2,1"]
|===
| Risk Level | Description | Impact | Mitigation Plan

| **Low**
| **Very Large Projects (>1000 pages)**
| Memory usage could exceed 100MB, startup >5s
| Current limit is 600 pages (tested). For larger projects, consider persistent index or pagination.

| **Low**
| **Non-Standard Markup**
| Custom AsciiDoc extensions may not parse correctly
| Parser focuses on standard syntax. Extensions would require parser enhancements.

| **Low**
| **Concurrent Write Conflicts**
| Multiple clients modifying same section simultaneously
| Last-write-wins currently. Could add optimistic locking in future.

| **Low**
| **Web Server Port Exhaustion**
| If ports 8080-8099 all in use
| Fails gracefully with error message. User can manually specify port.
|===

**Risk Assessment:** All remaining risks are **Low** severity. The system is production-ready for its target use cases (LLM-assisted documentation editing for projects up to 600 pages).

=== 11.3 Technical Debt (Current Status)

.Technical Debt Status
[cols="1,2,2,1"]
|===
| Item | Description | Status | Action Plan

| **Custom Parser**
| Custom document parser (ADR-005) requires ongoing maintenance
| ✅ **Manageable**
| 100% test coverage provides safety net. Re-evaluate quarterly for library alternatives.

| **~~No File Watching~~**
| ~~Index doesn't auto-refresh~~
| ✅ **REPAID**
| Implemented in Oct 2025 with watchdog library. Debt eliminated.

| **Monolithic mcp_server.py**
| ~~916-line file violated maintainability~~
| ✅ **REPAID**
| Refactored into 7 modules (Issue #12, ADR-006). Debt eliminated.

| **Insufficient Test Coverage**
| ~~Original design had minimal tests~~
| ✅ **REPAID**
| 82% coverage achieved (Issue #13, ADR-008). Debt eliminated.
|===

**Technical Debt Summary:**
- **Repaid:** 3 of 4 original debts eliminated
- **Remaining:** 1 manageable debt (custom parser)
- **New Debt:** None introduced

The aggressive debt repayment (Issues #12, #13, file watching implementation) resulted in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase than originally planned.

=== 11.4 Deferred Features (Not Technical Debt)

These features from PRD v1.0 were consciously deferred, not forgotten:

.Deferred Features
[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Feature | Reason for Deferral | Future Consideration

| **Real-time Diff Display (Web UI)**
| Complexity higher than expected, web UI functional without it
| Consider for v3.0 if user demand exists

| **get_elements() API**
| Requires sophisticated content parsing beyond section structure
| Would need parser enhancement for diagram/table/code extraction

| **get_summary() API**
| Requires LLM integration for AI-generated summaries
| Natural fit when LLM providers offer summarization APIs

| **replace_element() API**
| Complex interaction with content structure, low user demand
| Defer until specific use case emerges
|===

**Important Distinction:** These are **deferred features**, not technical debt. They were explicitly moved to "Future Features" in PRD v2.0 after evaluation. No code shortcuts were taken - the decision was made at design level.

=== 11.5 Monitoring and Review

**Debt Management Process:**

1. **Quarterly Review** - Re-evaluate custom parser alternatives
2. **Performance Monitoring** - Track memory/CPU with larger projects
3. **User Feedback** - Collect feedback on deferred features
4. **Library Updates** - Monitor AsciiDoc library ecosystem

**Success Criteria for Declaring Debt Paid:**
- Test coverage maintains >80%
- All files remain <500 lines
- No data corruption incidents
- Performance within quality goals (Chapter 10)

**Current Status:** ✅ All criteria met as of Oct 2025.
