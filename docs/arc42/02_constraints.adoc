== 2. Architecture Constraints

This chapter outlines the constraints that shape the architecture of the MCP Documentation Server.

=== 2.1 Technical Constraints

The system must adhere to the following technical constraints, derived directly from the PRD:

.Technical Constraints
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Constraint | Description
| **File-System Based** | The solution must not require a database. All data and state are to be managed directly on the file system.
| **Human-Readable Files** | Source documentation files (AsciiDoc, Markdown) must remain human-readable and editable with standard text editors at all times.
| **Toolchain Compatibility** | The system must work with existing AsciiDoc and Markdown toolchains without requiring proprietary formats or modifications.
| **Version Control Integration** | All operations must be compatible with standard Git workflows, ensuring that file changes can be tracked, committed, and reverted.

=== 2.2 Organizational and Process Constraints

| Constraint | Description
| **Workflow Integration** | The solution must integrate seamlessly into existing developer workflows without imposing significant process changes.
| **No External Services** | The system must be self-contained and not rely on any external or third-party services for its core functionality.
| **Phased Development** | The project will be developed in phases (Core Engine, MCP Integration, Web Interface), requiring a modular architecture that supports incremental delivery.

=== 2.3 Conventions

To ensure consistency and quality, the following conventions will be followed:

.Architectural Conventions

|===
| Convention | Description
| **MCP First** | The API design and implementation must be fully compliant with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard. This is a primary design driver.
| **Stateless Principle** | The core server logic will be designed to be as stateless as possible, treating the file system as the single source of truth for all content and structure.
| **Standard Markup** | The parsers will adhere to common AsciiDoc and Markdown standards. Support for non-standard or esoteric language features is a low priority.
| **Atomic Operations** | All file modification operations must be designed to be atomic to prevent data corruption and ensure file consistency.
