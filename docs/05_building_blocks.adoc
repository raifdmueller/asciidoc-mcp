== 5. Building Block View

This chapter describes the static decomposition of the system into its key building blocks. We use the C4 model to illustrate the structure at different levels of detail.

=== 5.1 Level 2: System Containers

The MCP Documentation Server system is composed of two main containers: a web-based user interface and the back-end API server. The file system acts as the system's database.

=== 5.2 Level 3: Components of the MCP API Server

We now zoom into the `MCP API Server` container. It is composed of several components, each with a distinct responsibility, reflecting a classic layered architecture.
