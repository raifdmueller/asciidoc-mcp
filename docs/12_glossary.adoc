== 12. Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the architecture documentation. Terms marked with *(Implemented)* were added during actual implementation (Oct 2025).

=== Core Concepts

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| **ADR**
| Architecture Decision Record. A document that captures an important architectural decision and its context and consequences. This project has 8 ADRs (see Chapter 9).

| **AST**
| Abstract Syntax Tree. A tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code. In our case, of a documentation project.

| **Atomic Write**
| An operation that is guaranteed to either complete fully or not at all, preventing partially-written, corrupted data. Implemented via backup-and-replace strategy (ADR-004).

| **Hierarchical Path**
| A human-readable path used to identify a specific section within the documentation project, e.g., `chapter-1.section-2`. Encodes the logical structure.

| **MCP**
| Model Context Protocol. A JSON-RPC based specification for how LLM-based agents should interact with external tools and data sources. This server implements MCP v1.0.

| **Mental Model** *(nach Naur)*
| The coherent theory that makes the code comprehensible. Documenting not just "what" was built, but "why" it makes sense. See Chapter 4.0.

| **Section**
| The fundamental unit of documentation - a logical chunk with a heading, content, and hierarchical position. Represented by the `Section` dataclass (see Chapter 5.4).

| **Structure Index**
| The in-memory data structure (`Dict[str, Section]`) that holds the metadata of the entire documentation project for fast O(1) lookups. See ADR-002.

=== Architectural Patterns *(Implemented)*

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| **Dependency Injection**
| Pattern where modules receive dependencies (like the server instance) rather than creating them. Avoids circular dependencies. See Chapter 8.4.

| **Extract-and-Delegate**
| Pattern where a thin orchestrator creates focused modules and delegates to them. Used in `MCPDocumentationServer` (ADR-006). See Chapter 8.4.

| **File-System-as-Truth**
| Pattern where files are the source of truth, not a cache. In-memory index is a performance optimization. See ADR-001 and Chapter 8.4.

| **Parse-Once, Query-Many**
| Pattern optimized for read-heavy workloads. Parse project once on startup, then serve queries from in-memory index. See Chapter 8.4.

=== Technical Components *(Implemented)*

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| **ContentEditor**
| Module (`content_editor.py`) responsible for atomic file modifications. Uses backup-and-replace strategy.

| **DocumentAPI**
| Module (`document_api.py`) implementing all document operations (get_structure, search_content, etc.). See ADR-006.

| **DocumentParser**
| Module (`document_parser.py`) that parses AsciiDoc/Markdown files and resolves includes. Custom implementation (ADR-005).

| **FileWatcher**
| Module (`file_watcher.py`) that monitors file system changes using the watchdog library and triggers auto-refresh. Added in Oct 2025.

| **ProtocolHandler**
| Module (`protocol_handler.py`) implementing MCP JSON-RPC protocol parsing and routing. See ADR-006.

| **WebserverManager**
| Module (`webserver_manager.py`) managing web server lifecycle, port finding, and browser auto-launch. See ADR-006.
|===

=== Testing *(Implemented)*

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| **Coverage**
| Percentage of code lines executed by tests. Project achieved 82% overall, 100% for critical modules (ADR-008).

| **Pytest**
| Testing framework used for all tests. Chosen for simplicity and fixture support (ADR-008).

| **Test Pyramid**
| Testing strategy with many unit tests, some integration tests, few end-to-end tests. See Chapter 8.5.

| **TDD** (Test-Driven Development)
| Development workflow: write failing test → implement → verify passing. User's global instruction, followed throughout project.
|===

=== Technical Debt & Quality *(Implemented)*

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| **Deferred Feature**
| Feature consciously moved to future (not forgotten). Example: Real-time diff display moved to v3.0. See Chapter 11.4.

| **PRD**
| Product Requirements Document. Specification of what should be built. Project has v1.0 (original vision) and v2.0 (actual state).

| **Technical Debt**
| Code shortcuts that need future cleanup. Project started with 4 debts, repaid 3 (see Chapter 11.3).
|===

=== Performance *(Implemented)*

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| **Debouncing**
| Technique to batch multiple rapid file change events to avoid re-parsing storm. File watcher uses 500ms debounce.

| **In-Memory Index**
| Performance optimization storing parsed structure in RAM (`Dict[str, Section]`). Enables <100ms API response times.

| **O(1) Lookup**
| Constant-time operation regardless of data size. Structure index provides O(1) section lookups by path.
|===

=== External Dependencies *(Implemented)*

[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| **FastAPI**
| Python web framework used for HTTP API and web UI. Provides automatic validation and OpenAPI docs.

| **Uvicorn**
| ASGI server that runs the FastAPI application. Supports async operations.

| **Watchdog**
| Python library for monitoring file system events (inotify on Linux, FSEvents on macOS). Used for auto-refresh.
