## Phase 1: Inventory & Gap Analysis - COMPLETE

### Current State Assessment

| Chapter | Size | Status | Priority | Gap Summary |
|---------|------|--------|----------|-------------|
| 01_introduction.adoc | 2.6K | ⚠️ Partial | Medium | Missing actual achievements vs goals |
| 02_constraints.adoc | 2.4K | ⚠️ Partial | Low | Missing discovered constraints |
| 03_context.adoc | 3.0K | ⚠️ Partial | Medium | Missing actual integrations (watchdog, etc.) |
| **04_solution_strategy.adoc** | **3.3K** | **🔴 Critical** | **HIGHEST** | **Missing mental model (Naur), no WHY** |
| **05_building_blocks.adoc** | **2.8K** | **🔴 Outdated** | **HIGHEST** | **Missing modular architecture (ADR-006)** |
| 06_runtime.adoc | 3.1K | ⚠️ Partial | High | Missing file watching, web server flows |
| 07_deployment.adoc | 1.3K | ⚠️ Minimal | Low | Missing port management, auto-launch |
| 08_cross_cutting.adoc | 2.0K | ⚠️ Partial | Medium | Missing patterns (Extract-Delegate, DI) |

| 11_risks.adoc | 2.3K | ⚠️ Outdated | Medium | Missing mitigated risks, remaining debt |
| 12_glossary.adoc | 894 | ⚠️ Minimal | Low | Missing new terms from implementation |

### Critical Gaps Identified

**1. Mental Model (Naur) - MISSING EVERYWHERE**
- No "WHY" documented, only "WHAT" and "HOW"
- Chapter 4 must explain the mental model that guides design
- Need to answer: "Why does this architecture make sense?"

**2. Modular Architecture - NOT DOCUMENTED**
- ADR-006 describes the split, but not in Building Blocks
- Missing: document_api.py, protocol_handler.py, webserver_manager.py
- C4 diagrams are outdated (show monolithic structure)

**3. Measured Results - NOT CAPTURED**
- Chapter 10 has goals, but no "we achieved X"
- Missing: 82% coverage, <2s startup, <100ms API calls
- Quality scenarios not validated

**4. Insights from Issues - NOT INTEGRATED**
- 13 resolved issues contain mental model insights
- Example: Issue #5 (hide includes) → "Logical ≠ Physical structure"
- These insights explain the "WHY" behind decisions

## Phase 2: Mental Model Extraction

### Mental Model Questions (nach Naur)

For each major component/decision, answer:

1. **What problem does this solve?** (user/developer perspective)
2. **Why this approach?** (the actual reasoning, not just alternatives)
3. **What assumptions underlie this?**
4. **How does this fit into the larger vision?**

### Mental Model from Issues #1-13

| Issue | Mental Model Insight |
|-------|---------------------|
| #5 Hide Includes | "Logical structure ≠ Physical structure. Users think in documents, not files." |
| #6 Folder Hierarchy | "Project organization mirrors mental organization. Subdirectories are semantic." |
| #11-12 Refactoring | "Code size directly impacts maintainability. <500 lines isn't arbitrary - it's cognitive limit." |
| #13 Test Infrastructure | "Tests = Executable specification. 82% coverage enabled safe refactoring." |
| #7-10 UI Polish | "Professional appearance = Trust. Small UI improvements compound to major UX gains." |

### Mental Model from ADRs

**ADR-001: File System as Truth**
- Mental Model: "The file is the document. No abstraction layer."
- Why: Simplicity, Git compatibility, human-readable
- Assumption: File system operations are atomic enough

**ADR-002: In-Memory Index**
- Mental Model: "Parse once, query many times."
- Why: 90% of operations are reads, parsing is expensive
- Assumption: Memory is cheap, project size is bounded

**ADR-006: Modular Architecture**
- Mental Model: "Each module = one concern = one mental context."
- Why: Cognitive load management, testability
- Assumption: Delegation overhead < clarity gain

## Phase 3: Update Priority Order

### Priority 1: Critical Chapters (Do First)

**1. Chapter 04: Solution Strategy** (~4 hours)
- [ ] Add Section 4.0: "Mental Model" (nach Naur)
- [ ] Document the "WHY" for each key decision
- [ ] Explain cognitive model: In-Memory Index + File-as-Truth
- [ ] Link to ADRs for detailed HOW

**2. Chapter 05: Building Blocks** (~3 hours)
- [ ] Add Section 5.3: "Modular MCP Server Architecture"
- [ ] Document 4 modules from ADR-006
- [ ] Update C4 component diagram
- [ ] Add Section 5.4: "Data Structures" (Section dataclass)

**3. Chapter 10: Quality Requirements** (~2 hours)
- [ ] Add Section 10.5: "Measured Results"
- [ ] Document actual achievements:
  - Performance: <2s startup, <100ms API
  - Reliability: 82% coverage, 0 corruption
  - Usability: MCP compliance verified
- [ ] Update scenarios with "✅ Achieved" status

### Priority 2: Important Updates

**4. Chapter 06: Runtime View** (~2 hours)
- [ ] Add sequence diagram: File watching flow
- [ ] Add sequence diagram: Web server startup
- [ ] Update MCP protocol interaction

**5. Chapter 11: Risks and Technical Debt** (~1 hour)
- [ ] Mark mitigated risks as ✅
- [ ] Document remaining technical debt:
  - Diff display not implemented
  - get_elements() deferred
  - AI summaries deferred

### Priority 3: Minor Updates

**6. Chapter 01: Introduction** (~1 hour)
- [ ] Add "Implementation Status" section
- [ ] Reference PRD v2.0 for current state

**7. Chapter 03: Context** (~1 hour)
- [ ] Update with actual integrations (watchdog, pytest)

**8. Chapter 08: Cross-Cutting Concepts** (~1 hour)
- [ ] Document Extract-and-Delegate pattern
- [ ] Document Dependency Injection
- [ ] Document testing strategy

**9. Chapter 12: Glossary** (~30 min)
- [ ] Add new terms from implementation

**10. Chapters 02, 07** (~30 min each)
- [ ] Minor updates, less critical

## Phase 4: Validation Checklist

- [ ] All 8 ADRs properly referenced and integrated
- [ ] Mental model documented in Chapter 4
- [ ] Insights from all 13 resolved issues incorporated
- [ ] No contradictions between PRD v2.0, ADRs, and arc42
- [ ] All measured results captured
- [ ] Diagrams updated to reflect actual implementation
- [ ] Cross-references verified
- [ ] Glossary complete

## Estimated Total Effort

- Priority 1 (Critical): 9 hours
- Priority 2 (Important): 3 hours
- Priority 3 (Minor): 4 hours
- **Total: ~16 hours**

## Next Steps

1. Start with Chapter 04 (Solution Strategy) - Add Mental Model
2. Then Chapter 05 (Building Blocks) - Add Modular Architecture
3. Then Chapter 10 (Quality) - Add Measured Results
4. Continue with Priority 2 and 3

## Success Criteria

The arc42 documentation should enable someone to:
1. **Understand WHY** the system is designed this way (Mental Model)
2. **Regenerate the code** from specification with high fidelity
3. **Make informed decisions** about future changes
4. **Onboard quickly** by understanding the rationale, not just the structure
