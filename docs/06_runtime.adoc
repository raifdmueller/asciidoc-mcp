== 6. Runtime View

This chapter illustrates how the system's components collaborate at runtime to fulfill key use cases.

=== 6.1 Scenario: Reading a Document Section

This is the most common read operation. A client requests the content of a specific section using its hierarchical path.

participant "MCP Client" as Client

Client -> Server: GET /section?path=chapter-1.section-2

Server -> Idx: find_section("chapter-1.section-2")
activate Idx
Idx --> Server: SectionLocation(file: "chapter1.adoc", start: 10, end: 50)
deactivate Idx

Server -> FS: read_lines("chapter1.adoc", 10, 50)
activate FS
FS --> Server: File Content
deactivate FS

Server --> Client: 200 OK (Content)
deactivate Server

=== 6.2 Scenario: Updating a Document Section

This scenario shows the critical write operation. The process must be atomic to ensure data integrity, as required by quality goal REL-1. This is achieved by writing to a temporary file first.

participant "File System Handler" as FSH
participant "File System" as FS

Client -> Server: POST /update_section\n(path: "chapter-1.section-2", content: "New text...")
activate Server

Server -> FSH: update_section("chapter-1.section-2", "New text...")
activate FSH

FSH -> FS: copy("chapter1.adoc", "chapter1.adoc.bak")
FSH -> FS: write_to_temp("chapter1.adoc.tmp", updated_content)

alt successful write
    FSH -> FS: move("chapter1.adoc.tmp", "chapter1.adoc")
    FSH -> FS: delete("chapter1.adoc.bak")
    FSH --> Server: Success
else write failed
    FSH -> FS: delete("chapter1.adoc.tmp")
    FSH -> FS: restore("chapter1.adoc.bak", "chapter1.adoc")
    FSH --> Server: Error
end

deactivate FSH

Server --> Client: 200 OK or 500 Error
deactivate Server

=== 6.3 Scenario: Server Initialization

When the server starts, it needs to parse the entire documentation project to build an in-memory index of the structure. This enables fast lookups for subsequent requests.

Server -> FS: list_files("**/*.adoc, **/*.md")
activate FS

loop for each file in file_list
    Server -> Parser: parse(file)
    activate Parser
    Parser -> FS: read_file(file)

    Parser --> Server: Document AST
    deactivate Parser

    Server -> Idx: build_index(AST)
    activate Idx
    Idx --> Server: done
    deactivate Idx
end

Server --> Operator: Server Ready
deactivate Server
