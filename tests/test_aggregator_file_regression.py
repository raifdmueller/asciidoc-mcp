"""
Regression test for aggregator file bug fix.

This test ensures that aggregator files (files with include:: statements)
show all their sections correctly in the web interface, not just one section.

Bug fixed: https://github.com/example/asciidoc-mcp-q/issues/XXX
Root cause: 
1. Build directory files were overriding docs files in file discovery
2. Aggregator file logic was not correctly matching sections to source files
