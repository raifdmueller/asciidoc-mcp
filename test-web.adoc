image::docs/images/web-03-section-expanded.png[Section Expanded with Content, 800]

*Issues Found:* None

=== ⚠️ Test 4: Section Content Loading

*Purpose:* Test content display for individual sections.

*Test Steps:*
1. Click on "Features (0)" subsection
2. Wait for content to load
3. Verify content display

*Result:* ⚠️ **PARTIAL FAIL**

*Error Observed:*
----
Error loading content
----

*Expected Behavior:*
Should display the "Features" section content from README.md:
----
- **Hierarchical Navigation**: Access document structure without loading entire files
- **Include Resolution**: Automatically resolves AsciiDoc include directives
- **Content Search**: Search across all documentation content
...
----

*Root Cause Analysis:*
The section ID sent to the API endpoint likely doesn't match the expected format, or the API is not properly handling section content requests for leaf sections.

*Impact:* 🟡 **Medium** - Content loading works for parent sections but fails for some child sections

*Workaround:* Click on parent section instead of leaf section

*Recommendation:* Fix the `/api/section/{section_id}` endpoint to handle all section types

=== ✅ Test 5: Load Metadata Feature

*Purpose:* Test the metadata endpoint and display.

*Test Steps:*
1. Click "Load Metadata" button
2. Wait for metadata to load
3. Verify JSON display in right panel
4. Analyze metadata content

*Result:* ✅ **PASS** (with data quality issue)

*Observations:*

- JSON formatted and displayed in right panel
- **Key Metadata Fields:**
  * `project_root`: "."
  * `total_sections`: 116
  * `total_words`: 3592
  * `root_files`: Array of file objects

*Sample Output:*
[source,json]

*Screenshot:*

image::docs/images/web-04-metadata.png[Metadata Display with Duplication Bug, 800]

*Issues Found:* 🔴 **DATA DUPLICATION BUG**

**Bug Description:**
The `root_files` array contains massive duplication - the same 4 files are repeated approximately 12 times each, resulting in 48+ entries instead of 4.

**Expected:**
----
"root_files": [
  { "file": "README.md", ... },
  { "file": "AmazonQ.md", ... },
  { "file": "CLAUDE.md", ... },
  { "file": "test-mcp.adoc", ... }
]
----

**Actual:**
The same 4 files repeated 12+ times

**Root Cause:**
Likely in `mcp_server.py` - the `_discover_root_files()` method is appending to `self.root_files` without clearing it first, or being called multiple times.

**Impact:** 🟡 Medium - Metadata is correct, but presentation is cluttered

**Recommendation:** Add `self.root_files = []` at the start of `_discover_root_files()` method

=== ✅ Test 6: Validate Structure Feature

*Purpose:* Test document structure validation and warning display.

*Test Steps:*
1. Click "Validate Structure" button
2. Wait for validation to complete
3. Verify JSON display
4. Analyze warnings

*Result:* ✅ **PASS**

*Observations:*
- Validation completed instantly (~50ms)
- JSON formatted and displayed
- **Validation Results:**
  * `valid`: true
  * `issues`: [] (empty)
  * `warnings`: 6 warnings found
  * `total_sections`: 116
  * `validation_timestamp`: "2025-09-30T15:16:36.025414"

*Warnings Identified:*
[source]
----
1. Level inconsistency: access-httplocalhost8082.3-use-with-amazon-q-cli (level 3) under access-httplocalhost8082 (level 1)
2. Level inconsistency: check-coverage.development-server (level 3) under check-coverage (level 1)
3. Level inconsistency: access-httplocalhost8082.git-workflow (level 3) under access-httplocalhost8082 (level 1)
4. Level inconsistency: -rest-of-init.bug-2-test-suite-import-errors (level 3) under -rest-of-init (level 1)
5. Level inconsistency: -rest-of-init.bug-3-debug-logging-to-production-files (level 3) under -rest-of-init (level 1)
6. Level inconsistency: in-code.bug-4-level-inconsistencies-in-documentation (level 3) under in-code (level 1)
----

*Analysis:*
These warnings correctly identify heading level jumps in the source documentation (h1 → h3, skipping h2). This is a **legitimate issue in the documentation**, not a bug in the validator.

*Screenshot:*

image::docs/images/web-05-validation.png[Validation Results, 800]

*Issues Found:* None in the validator itself

*Validator Quality:* Excellent - correctly identifies structural issues

=== ✅ Test 7: Panel Resizing (Visual Inspection)

*Purpose:* Verify the resizable split-pane functionality.

*Test Method:* Visual inspection of screenshots

*Result:* ✅ **PASS**

*Observations:*
- Resize handle visible between left and right panels (5px grey bar)
- Handle has hover effect (changes to blue on hover)
- Default split: ~40% left, ~60% right
- Cookie-based persistence mentioned in JavaScript code

*Features Detected in Source:*
- Mouse-based drag-and-drop resizing
- Constrained between 20% and 80% width
- Position saved to cookie for persistence
- Smooth resizing without jumps

*Issues Found:* None (visual inspection only - interactive testing would require mouse events)

=== ✅ Test 8: CodeMirror Integration

*Purpose:* Verify syntax highlighting and code display.

*Result:* ✅ **PASS**

*Observations:*
- CodeMirror library loaded from CDN
- Version: 5.65.2
- Read-only mode enabled
- Line numbers displayed
- Line wrapping enabled
- Mode: text/plain (no syntax highlighting for content sections)
- Diff mode available but not tested

*CodeMirror Features Available:*

== Bugs Summary

=== 🔴 Critical Bugs

*None identified* - All critical path features work

=== 🟡 High Priority Bugs

**Bug #1: Section Content Loading Failure**

*Severity:* 🔴 High

*Location:* `/api/section/{section_id}` endpoint

*Description:*
When clicking on certain leaf sections (e.g., "Features (0)"), the right panel displays "Error loading content" instead of the section content.

*Reproduction:*
1. Load structure
2. Expand "MCP Documentation Server"
3. Click "Features (0)"
4. Observe error message

*Expected:* Section content should display

*Actual:* "Error loading content"

*Impact:* Users cannot view content for affected sections

*Recommendation:*
1. Check API endpoint `/api/section/{section_id}`
2. Verify section ID format matches what backend expects
3. Add logging to identify which section IDs fail
4. Ensure all section types (parent, leaf, level 1-4) work consistently

=== 🟡 Medium Priority Bugs

**Bug #2: root_files Duplication in Metadata**

*Severity:* 🟡 Medium

*Location:* `mcp_server.py::_discover_root_files()`

*Description:*
The metadata endpoint returns the same 4 files repeated 12+ times in the `root_files` array, resulting in 48+ entries instead of 4.

*Root Cause:*
The `_discover_root_files()` method likely appends to `self.root_files` without clearing it first, or is being called multiple times during initialization.

*Code Location:*
```python
def _discover_root_files(self):
    """Find main documentation files"""
    patterns = ['*.adoc', '*.md', '*.asciidoc']
    for pattern in patterns:
        for file in self.project_root.glob(pattern):
            if not file.name.startswith('_'):
                self.root_files.append(file)  # ← Should clear list first?
```

*Recommendation:*
```python
def _discover_root_files(self):
    """Find main documentation files"""
    self.root_files = []  # ← Add this line to clear before discovering
    patterns = ['*.adoc', '*.md', '*.asciidoc']
    for pattern in patterns:
        for file in self.project_root.glob(pattern):
            if not file.name.startswith('_'):
                self.root_files.append(file)
```

*Impact:* Cluttered metadata output, wasted bandwidth

*Estimated Fix Time:* 5 minutes

=== 🟢 Low Priority Issues

**Issue #1: No Search Functionality**

Users must manually browse the tree to find sections. A search box would improve usability for large documentation sets.

**Issue #2: Generic Error Messages**

Errors show "Error loading content" without details. More specific error messages would help debugging.

**Issue #3: No Content Rendering**

Content is displayed as plain text. Rendering Markdown/AsciiDoc would improve readability.
